This the my repository for my codewars solutions in JavaScript.

## Problems
### 01 - Persistent Bugger (6th Kyu)
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:
```javascript
persistence(39) === 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      // and 4 has only one digit

persistence(999) === 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                      // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

persistence(4) === 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
```

### 02 - Ones and Zeros
Given an array of one's and zero's convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1
```javascript
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
```
